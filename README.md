# BakerySystem
A system that controls the solds in a bakery 

The system will be developed using MySQL as our database, PyQT5 as graphic interface and Python as the main programming languague

The system must have the interface that will allow the operator to insert the code associate with some product of the Bakery, after that the backend will search in the database for the corresponding data for that product, returning them for the interface and, if there has enough products in the bakery's inventory, the product will be add to the cart. Another feature of that interface is to consolidate the sale and send to the backend the data for update the bakery's inventory table and the sale_historic table.

The system must also have a interface allowed only for administration, they should be able to add and update itens to the inventory, create logins and password for others adm, and they should have a area that will give them the capacity for analyse the sale_historic by date, code, name and see the total incoming.
